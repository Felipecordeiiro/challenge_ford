This happened in January 2022 and December 2024. The vehicle was parked both times.  No warning just a loud boom noise. When getting in the car and gently closing the door after the glass shatters the glass fell into the back of the vehicle going everywhere.  This is a major safety issue as the shattered glass can severely injure an adult/baby/pet.  Twice this was replaced by my insurance company that I pay a pretty hefty premium on.  I have been in contact with American Honda and they seem to be aware of the issue but only offer to possibly issue a onetime good faith reimbursement for one window which does not resolve this safety concern from happening over and over again.  In 2022, the glass was replaced and the vehicle had to be taken to a body shop for the remaining glass to be vacuumed out and a solution applied to catch the remaining glass that rattled in the hatch.  Only 90% was removed.  In 2024 the glass was replaced 2 times as the first one was a defect and appeared wavy when driving.  The glass went everywhere when being replaced all over my garage and driveway.  The glass shop could only clean/vacuum so much. The glass continues to fall out of the tailgate when the hatch is opening/closing or when just pulling out of the driveway onto the road.  When contacting American Honda they refused to pay for the tailgate to be vacuumed and solution applied and informed that I need to contact my local dealer.  When I contacted my local Acura dealer they were willing to do the service but for a fee.  American Honda currently has a class action lawsuit out of California for this issue.  The only resolution is to replace the entire tailgate.

In September 2021, the rear windshield/glass exploded on its own while parked in our driveway.  My wife started the vehicle and turned on the front and back defrosters.

Windshield was repaired, however, small  pieces of broken glass still remain inside the tailgate panel, and both dealership and glass replacment facility reprensetatives indicated that the way the rear tailgate is desiged, it is impossible to get every piece of glass out.  Since September 2021 till now, you can hear pieces of glass moving around inside the rear tailgate, as if they were Maracas playing in a Latin band.  On 12/22/24, this time while driving the vehicle, we heard a very loud 'gunshot' sound coming from the rear of the car.  The noise was so startling that my wife's natural reaction (she was operating the vehicle at the time) was to duck, and in so doing, she pulled the steering wheel to the right (in the direction that my wife leaned).  Thankfully there were no pedestrians, vehicles, or any object.  Quickly after regaining control, she pulled over only to realize the rear windshield glass had shattered, yet again.    In calling the dealership, I'm told the vehicle is out of warranty, and there is nothing that can be done.  In 2021, while the vehicle was under manufacturer's warranty, they still did nothing, hence the reason why it was repaired at a facility in the secondary market.

At some point the breaks started working, after I gave it a little gas?  I got the car into drive, and tested it before moving on to verify it was behaving correctly.

To date, no parts for addressing this issue have been available and no timeline has been made available as to when parts would be available. I am planning my annual trip to the Eastern Sierra in early September where no Acura dealer is available nearby. Should the fuel pump fail during that trip it would be a significant inconvenience for me, including interruption of medical appointments, room and board expenses, pet sitting expenses, etc., as I have been told by Honda that in such an emergency situation the car would have to be towed to the nearest dealership, with the part being specially ordered which would take 2 weeks and that I may be responsible for my room and board, and other costs during that period. I find this behavior to be outrageous. Additionally I have been told by my local dealer that it is not possible to determine possible failure beforehand as either it is working or it has failed. This is totally opposite from what I was told by Honda which was to schedule an appointment with a dealer to determine the status of the fuel pump so that they could special order one for replacement if it demonstrated potential failure.  This entire issue reeks of poor and ineffective management of this situation by Honda, likely putting costs over safety putting me at substantial risk for this trip that was planned a year ago and likely will cost me my deposit and access privileges if canceled.

Fortunately, no one was near the car at the time, including our toddler and infant grandchildren, whom we transport in this vehicle twice a week.  A quick search revealed that there have been reported defects and incidents of shattering windshields in 2019-2023 Acura RDX models. We were dismayed to learn that Honda has been aware of this issue since 2020 and has only notified its dealers in 2023. We understand that American Honda is currently facing legal action for not addressing this defect adequately. We were shocked and concerned that we had not been made aware of this issue, given the safety risks involved. We immediately contacted the dealership from which we purchased the car, seeking guidance on how to safely get the vehicle to them for repair. We assumed that Honda would take responsibility for this known defect. However, we were informed by two managers, that Honda is not taking responsibility for this issue.  The thick black glass exploded with a loud and startling sound. The broken glass surrounded inside and outside of the car and continued to fall as we researched what to do.

We were lucky it happened on a back road and not on highway with hi velocity just an hour earlier because this would have killed us. The car came to a complete stall in the middle of the road, the red battery sign came on and the car would not start. We had a very poor cell phone reception, it took us over 3 hours to get a tow track, by the time the truck arrived we were shivering from cold. The car is impossible to put in neutral while in full stall that makes removing car from the road and  towing near impossible. The car got towed to the nearest Acura repair center in PA. We were left with no car with a minor in the middle of the night in the cold out of state with very limited financial resources. As of now the car is still at the repair shop in PA, we are back in Maryland without any vehicle. The repair shop told us that there is no fuel pressure and it is likely fuel pump failure, that has already been reported and recalled on other Acura RDX 2019, but for some reason is not associated with our VIN. This is a major safety concern with a faulty part on a 4 years old car that could have potentially killed us and now is putting unimaginable financial, logistical and emotional hardship on us being left without a vehicle out of state and absolutely no timeline on when this very costly repair will be done due to unavailability of the part.  Please issue a recall on this VIN  ASAP before somebody will get hurt.

THERE WAS SOME TRAFFIC COMING FROM THE LEFT AND SOME COMING FROM THE RIGHT, BUT THERE WAS ROOM TO MERGE AND TURN LEFT ONTO THIS FEEDER, TO EXIT THE LOT.

I SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES, AND THE CAR STOPPED.    #2. I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY FOR AT LEAST 20 MINUTES AND THEN EXITED THE FREEWAY TO GO HOME.  AS I NEARED THE LEFT TURN TO ENTER OUR STREET, I STOPPED TO LET ONCOMING TRAFFIC CLEAR, AND THEN I RELEASED THE FOOT BRAKE AND BEGAN TO TURN AND SLOWLY PRESS ON THE GAS PEDAL.  AGAIN, THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE AT A FASTER RATE THAN WAS SAFE ONTO OUR NARROW STREET AND UP A SMALL HILL WITH LIMITED VISIBILITY.  AGAIN, I SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES, AND THE CAR STOPPED ' THANKFULLY OUT OF THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC THAT I HAD JUST CROSSED.    IN BOTH SCENARIOS, I HAD NOT BEEN USING ANY CRUISE CONTROL OR ACC.

INCIDENTS OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING IN OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA ON COOL DAYS (AMBIENT TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 30 AND 50 DEG FAHRENHEIT), WITH AND WITHOUT RAINFALL. THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS WERE TRUE FOR BOTH OCCURRENCES.

I DEPRESS THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WITHOUT DISABLING THE CRUISE CONTROL FUNCTIONS AND CHANGE LANES TO THE FASTER LANE. JUST AS I EXECUTE THIS MANEUVER, THE ENGINE SIMULTANEOUSLY GOES INTO LIMP MODE -- THE MAXIMUM POWER OUTPUT DECREASES DRAMATICALLY AND THE MALFUNCTION INDICATION LAMP (CEL) IS BLINKING. AT THIS POINT I HAVE TO GET ACROSS ALL LANES OF THE HIGHWAY TO PULL ONTO THE SHOULDER, AND I HAVE TO DO THIS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS SLOWING DOWN. REFERENCING MY OWNER'S GUIDE, I SEE THAT THE BLINKING CEL INDICATES A MISFIRE IN THE ENGINE'S CYLINDERS IS DETECTED, AND AS INSTRUCTED I TURN OFF THE ENGINE IN A ""SAFE"" PLACE AND WAIT FOR THE ENGINE TO COOL DOWN. WHEN I RESTART THE ENGINE, THE CEL IS CLEARED AND THE VEHICLE RESUMES NORMAL FUNCTION.  I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN FOR ITS FIRST SERVICE APPOINTMENT YESTERDAY. I PROVIDED THIS ANECDOTE TO MY SERVICE ADVISOR, AND ASKED THAT WE CHECK ERROR CODE LOGS AND INSPECT COMPONENT SYSTEMS FOR DAMAGE.
