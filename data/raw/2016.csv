The right lane was packed with 18-wheelers. In order to avoid constantly breaking the full length of the hill, I shifted into manual mode and a lower gear, but the car ahead began to brake suddenly and hard. Just a second before that car broke, I unlocked the shifter and was moving it forward to Drive. As the car ahead was drastically slowing, I had to hit the brakes hard to avoid rear-ending him, and the momentum of sudden braking threw my hand and the shifter all the way forward into Park. The transmission immediately produced a harsh grinding sound, I no longer could disengage the transmission from Park, and the only controls I now had were brakes and steering. Alarmed I knew I had to get to the right shoulder but I couldn't look back to see how close trucks were behind the one to my immediate right, but by braking that truck slowly moved ahead of me, providing a brief opening behind him in the right lane. As I cautiously moved into that opening, I could see an 18 wheeler approaching but still a short distance back. I continued slowly drifting into the right lane with blinkers on, when suddenly the approaching truck behind veered partially into the right shoulder in anticipation of passing me in the narrow shoulder lane. In the split second of his veering, I slowly continued into the shoulder lane causing him to veer back into the right lane, his rig full of new cars jerking back left. As I gradually slowed to a stop, the truck was approaching so fast that in my rearview mirror it looked like he might not miss me. As he shot by, he cleared me by not much more than a foot, his draft shaking my car. AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION GOING INTO PARK @ 70MPH",Vehicle,2016,ACURA,RDX

THIS IS FINE IF YOU ARE LOW ON AIR.  BUT IF YOU HAVE A BLOW OUT, SHRED THE TIRE, OR BREAK A RIM YOU ARE STRANDED INDEFINITELY. I BELIEVE THAT THIS CAUSES UNNECESSARY RISK TO DRIVERS AND A MINI SPARE SHOULD BE PROVIDED AS A MINIMUM. ALSO THE SPARE STORAGE SHOULD ACCOMMODATE THE FULL SIZE TIRE AND RIM FOR THOSE OF US THAT BELIEVE A MINI SPARE ALONE IS A DANGER TO TO THE DRIVER SAFETY BECAUSE DEGRADED BRAKING AND HANDLING DURING USE.",Vehicle,2016,ACURA,RDX
