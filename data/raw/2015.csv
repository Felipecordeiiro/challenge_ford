Yes, the vehicle has been inspected by both the Acura dealership and a third-party service provider, Midas.

The only way I could see to drive at night was with my bright lights on. I contacted a local Acura repair shop and they indicated there is a manufacturing problem with the 2015 Acura RDX-the reflective material in the low beam headlights delaminates and reflect la minimal light forward, meaning there is very little light to illuminate what is in front of me at night. This meant my only two options to operate my car at night were to risk being unable to see what was in front of me since there was minimal lights going forward on low beams, or to drive with my high beams on at night blinding oncoming traffic. Neither option is acceptable. This known manufacturing defect is not being corrected if the vehicle is outside of its warranty. I contacted my Acura dealer and spoke with Casey in the service department who told me they weren’t offering any assistance and that it would cost me approximately $3,000 to fix this known manufacturing defect.

I searched online and realized this was a safety problems many drivers have complained and contacted Acura dealers; unfortunately, Acura seems not like to look into this common defect. Please see the attached link of these complains. https://www.carproblemzoo.com/acura/rdx/2014/headlights-problems.php   I am reaching out to you to ask for your investigation and hopeful you could force Acura to make a recall for replacement to repair. this is a serious safety issue on Acura which we liked a lot, but we are afraid driving in dark due to this big issue. it is not safe and could lead to severe injuries to many who drive it. thanks so much.

I googled the problem and found a whole litany of Acura RDX owners who have experienced the same problem at the same time. see: https://www.carproblemzoo.com/acura/rdx/headlights-problems.php  I have contacted Acura who acknowledge that they have replaced some of the 2015 RDX headlight issues, but only if the car was built in 2014. The 2014 RDX did experience a recall for the same, exact reason. However, when I checked my VIN, they say that it doesn't qualify for the recall.  This is crazy. My car cannot be driven at night, and the estimated repair for a problem due to their shoddy design/workmanship is approx $1250 per headlight! Unacceptable.
