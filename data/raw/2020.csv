Specifically, the rear window glass has unexpectedly shattered on two separate occasions without any apparent cause or external interference.  What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? The rear window glass is the component that failed, and it is available for inspection upon request.  How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? The sudden shattering of the rear window glass posed a significant safety risk. Broken glass could have flown into my eyes or injured anyone near the vehicle.  Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Yes, Acura is aware of this issue as it has been reported by other owners of similar models.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives, or others? The police have inspected the vehicle following the incidents.  Were there any warning lamps, messages, or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? No, there were no warning lamps, messages, or other symptoms prior to the failure.  To provide more context: The first incident occurred during cold, snowy weather, which I initially suspected might be a contributing factor. However, the second incident took place during moderate weather conditions, eliminating extreme temperatures as a possible cause. Both times, the vehicle was stationary while I was inside my workplace, and surveillance footage confirmed that no individuals or external factors were near the vehicle.  After researching this issue, I found that other Acura RDX owners, particularly models from 2019-2024, have experienced similar occurrences of rear window glass shattering without cause.
