The problem I encountered while driving jeopardizes the safety of both myself and others on the road.  About five days ago, while driving at approximately 20 mph, my vehicle began emitting loud, thunderous sounds, accompanied by intense vibrations that shook the entire car. Additionally, it seemed to struggle when shifting gears, particularly into second or third gear. Despite my careful and gradual acceleration, the car exhibited signs of a malfunction within its transmission system.  Furthermore, at around 35 mph, the engine suddenly revved to over 3000 rpm, causing the vehicle to accelerate without any input from me. This acceleration occurred even though my foot was not on the gas pedal, making the car difficult to control and putting me at risk of colliding with other vehicles or objects. The unpredictability of these incidents is deeply alarming and could lead to serious accidents if not addressed promptly.  I purchased this vehicle in December 2023 and have maintained it according to the manufacturer's recommendations. However, when I inquired about the timing belt at the dealership, I was assured that it had passed inspection. Despite this, the recent malfunctions suggest a more serious underlying issue that needs immediate attention.  Crucially, there were no warning lights, messages, or other indications of a problem prior to these incidents, underscoring the sudden and unexpected nature of the issue.  I urge the NHTSA to investigate this matter urgently and thoroughly. I request that you initiate a recall of affected vehicles and implement necessary repairs to address the identified defects.

THE SHIFTS SEEM MUCH HARSHER ESPECIALLY WHEN DOWNSHIFTING.  WHEN THE CAR SLOWS DOWN, THERE IS A SUDDEN JERK AND A NOTICEABLE DROP IN SPEED.  I'VE CONCLUDED THAT IT OCCURS MOST WHEN THE TRANSMISSION DOWNSHIFTS FROM GEAR 5 TO 4 (AROUND 30-35 MPH) AND 4 TO 3 (AT 20 MPH).  IT ALMOST APPEARS THAT WHEN THE CAR IS IN ""DRIVE"" IT SHIFTS TOO EARLY CAUSING THE CAR TO JERK AND SLOW DOWN AS IF I QUICKLY PRESSED THE BRAKES (I.E. ENGINE BRAKING).  I ALSO HAVE NOTICED THAT WHEN THE CAR IS IN ""SPORT"" MODE, THE HARSH DOWNSHIFT IS NOT AS EVIDENT AND MUCH SMOOTHER/NORMAL. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AS THE SUDDEN JERK & SLOW-DOWNS ARE UNEXPECTED FOR DRIVERS BEHIND ME, ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE ARE NO VISUAL INDICATORS/WARNINGS (E.G. BRAKE LIGHTS DON'T COME WHEN THIS HAPPENS).  PLUS NOT TO MENTION A WASTE OF MY GAS AS I HAVE TO PRESS THE GAS TO GET IT BACK UP THE CRUISING SPEED NEEDED.  I BROUGHT THIS UP TO THE SERVICE TEAM AT ACURA MCGRATH IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY PURCHASE AND SO FAR I'VE HEARD THAT ""ACURA TRANSMISSIONS ARE QUITE STRANGE AND HAVE THEIR OWN NUANCES COMPARED TO ALL OTHER CAR MAKES AND THIS DOWNSHIFTING THAT I EXPERIENCE IS BY DESIGN"".
