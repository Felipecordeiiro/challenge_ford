We were concerned and I proactively paid to have it replaced.  The service technicians suspected that something might have entered the belt and was preventing the mechanism of working correctly.  However, upon replacing the buckle, the service technician reported that the belt buckle had no foreign objects inside it, and appears to have been mechanically failing.  This was alarming, and I quickly searched online to find the current seatbelt recall.  However, my vehicle is not a part of that, but maybe should be given the technician's findings.  The technician's report can be found through Acura of Concord, and has a reference number of RO#203423 / Tag# 172B.  I asked the technician for the faulty belt and currently have it in my possession (pictures of it sticking are attached, this is the first and only time I've touched it since the appointment).    Please let us know, we'd like to make sure these vehicles are as safe as they can be for all purchasers.  Appreciate your time and attention here. ",Vehicle,2018,ACURA,RDX
