At higher speeds on the highway - it’s even more concerning.  I’ve had them checked when I bought the car for alignment and replaced the bulbs with high definition bulbs. I’ve also had the lenses professionally cleaned all with no improvement.  I have to drive around with my high beams on constantly and in fog and rain and this is sometimes also problematic.  It’s so unsafe and you don’t think to check “if the headlights are good enough “ when you buy a car.  It’s not something that should vary.

A few nights ago I was leaving my nieces 5 year old bday party in a residential area that does not have street lighting, it was then that I turned my low beams on for the first time. I thought something was wrong with them because I could barely see. It was a clear night without rain but I was still unable to see anything further than approx 4ft in front of my vehicle (I cant imagine how dangerous it is when raining). As I started to accelerate to the speed limit I was approaching what looked a shadow of parked cars on the left side of the street. Just as I was approaching those cars to pass, a man walked onto the street from in between the cars, Im assuming to cross the street to get to a house. I did not see him and he did not see me until he was feet away from the corner of my car. I slammed on my breaks and he jumped out of the way in impeccable timing. Luckily, I was not going too fast since it was a residential area however, had he not seen me in that exact matter of time, he could have got seriously injured or killed. This was the first time I ever had to use my headlights, had I known how bad the lighting would be, I would never have drove that vehicle at night nor would I have purchased it. What’s the point in purchasing a vehicle you can only drive in the day and lose your freedom of choice to drive at night. That’s ridiculous.

Basic Introduction:  Like hundreds of people all over the internet, my 2014 Acura RDX base model's low-beam headlights deteriorated to the point of being of no use while driving.  Quite literally, without exaggeration, at night, I saw nothing but a faint glow on the street immediately in front of the car.    Q. What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? The LOW BEAM headlights failed, becoming dim to the point of extreme danger.  I had to literally avoid driving anywhere at night.  And yes: I replaced the headlights with aftermarket replacements (not trusting the manufacturer), and I have the original headlights still in my possession.  Q. How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? I was fortunate to be in a househould with more than one car, where I was able to simply never drive the car at night, other than occasions where we were out later than expected, and had to get home with virtually no usable low-beams.   Other people who only had one car, who had no choice, and most commonly, people whose low-beams deteriorated so gradually that they didn't notice, are driving around all over America.  We are all at risk.  Q. Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Many people in online communities have contacted dealers, but I personally did not, other than asking a service rep about it.  In my case, the person either didn't know, or pretended they didn't know about the problem.   Q. Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? No.  By avoiding driving it, having other cars, and being careful, there was no accident in my situation.   Q. Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? None, other than finally realizing the low beam headlights were not of any use.  I noticed in Summer 2020, at approx. 62,000 miles.",Vehicle,2014,ACURA,RDX

IN CONSIDER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND THE BLUETOOTH INTERFACE 'UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED'.  ACURA IN ITS INFINITE WISDOM DECIDED NOT TO OFFER A TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE AND TO DISABLE MANUAL CONTROLS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION. 1 - THIS PREVENTS A PASSENGER FROM ENTERING TRIP DESTINATION. 2 - DETAILS OF A LOCATION MUST BE ENTERED ONE CHARACTER AT A TIME. 3 - THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE BY VOICE COMMAND FROM THE DRIVER'S STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS. 4 - AFTER PRESSING THE TALK BUTTON TWICE AND SPEAKING A LETTER, THE SYSTEMS RESPONDS WITH THREE NUMBERED CHOICES THAT MUST BE SELECTED BY PRESSING THE TALK BUTTON TWICE AND SPEAKING THE NUMBER NEXT TO THE CORRECT LETTER.  THIS MUST BE REPEATED FOR EVERY LETTER IN THE PLACE NAME, STREET NAME, STREET NUMBER AND CITY.  IT IS SO DISTRACTING TO BE INFINITELY MORE DANGEROUS THAN A TOUCH INTERFACE.    TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE PRE-LOADED MAP IS INACCURATE. FOR INSTANCE, CALIFORNIA STATE HIGHWAY 1 IS NOT CATEGORIZED AS A MAJOR ROAD.  SO DIRECTIONS FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BIG SURE FOR EXAMPLE WILL BE 2.5 HOURS LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WANTS TO TAKE THE DRIVER DOWN TO SAN LUIS OBISPO AND THEN BACK NORTH UP THE COAST ON US 101.    NEITHER THE SALES DEPARTMENT, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THE MAPPING COMPANY OR ACURA CLIENT RELATIONS SEEM TO BE REAL CONCERNED.    THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF APPROXIMATELY $3,000.  WE MUST RELY ON A GARMIN IN THE CAR TO GET ACCURATE AND SAFE USAGE FOR NAVIGATION.    WE HAVE A CASE NUMBER WITH ACURA CLIENT RELATIONS AND WE WILL PURSUE THIS UNTIL WE RECEIVE A FIX OR RECOMPENSE.

THE BRAKE PADS MAKE A VERY LOUD METAL ON METAL SOUND AGAINST CALIPER CLIPS OVER BUMPS, POT HOLES AND LANE DIVIDERS. ACURA CLAIMS THIS IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CAR.  PHYSICS TELLS ME THAT METAL ON METAL WILL EVENTUALLY WEAR CAUSING BRAKE PAD FAILURE. DEALER IS CONCERNED AND FEELS EXPLANATION FROM ACURA IS UNSATISFACTORY. ACURA REPRESENTATIVE WILL WRITE A REPORT TO MANUFACTURER. ALL 2014 RDX MODELS HAVE SAME PROBLEM.  DEALER CAN NOT SAY THAT THERE IS NOT A SAFETY PROBLEM. DEALER SAYS, ""I DON'T THINK THERE IS A SAFETY PROBLEM"". THERE NEEDS TO BE AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS ISSUE, BECAUSE IT AFFECTS HUNDREDS OF RDX OWNERS.  THE MANUFACTURER TO THIS POINT HAS HAD A VERY CAVALIER ATTITUDE THAT THE METAL ON METAL SITUATION JUST COMES WITH THE CAR. THE DEALER CONFIRMS,""THE NOISE ISSUE IS SUBSTANTIAL"". THE DEALER HAS BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO ISOLATE THE ISSUE, BUT HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY BACK-UP OR HELP FROM THE ACURA. DEALER HAS USED RUBBERIZED PAINT AND NEW BRAKE PADS TO QUIET NOISE, BUT HAS TOLD ME THAT IT IS NOT A FIX.  IT IS DONE FOR DIAGNOSES PURPOSES.
