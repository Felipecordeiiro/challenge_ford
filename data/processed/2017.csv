11035916,honda (american honda motor co.),0,0,0,0,,,5J8TB4H39HL,power train,1 harsh transmission shifts  the transmissions gear shifts both up and down are jerky and its very obvious  unpleasant when compared to driving other cars even to a 2005 toyota corolla  the shifts seem much harsher especially when downshifting  when the car slows down there is a sudden jerk and a noticeable drop in speed  ive concluded that it occurs most when the transmission downshifts from gear 5 to 4 around 3035 mph and 4 to 3 at 20 mph  it almost appears that when the car is in drive it shifts too early causing the car to jerk and slow down as if i quickly pressed the brakes ie engine braking  i also have noticed that when the car is in sport mode the harsh downshift is not as evident and much smoothernormal this is a significant safety issue as the sudden jerk  slowdowns are unexpected for drivers behind me especially since there are no visual indicatorswarnings eg brake lights dont come when this happens  plus not to mention a waste of my gas as i have to press the gas to get it back up the cruising speed needed  i brought this up to the service team at acura mcgrath immediately after my purchase and so far ive heard that acura transmissions are quite strange and have their own nuances compared to all other car makes and this downshifting that i experience is by design  however during both of my test drives at 2 different dealerships i did not feel this at all  my friends who have driven with me have also noticed this and mentioned its unpleasant and unexpected for a luxury car      even after the memory reset that we did a couple weeks ago this is still noticeable on both up  downshifts again harshest shift experienced when down shifting when slowing down at 20 mph,vehicle,2017,acura,rdx,13,leve
